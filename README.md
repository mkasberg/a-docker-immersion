# Container Immersion
üê≥ A tour that walks through the fundamentals of Docker. Learn Docker by doing
it.

Go to [**Container Immersion**](https://mkasberg.github.io/container-immersion).

Or, skip ahead to the [Table of
Contents](https://mkasberg.github.io/container-immersion/toc.html).

Container Immersion is a Docker tutorial website built with
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This
repository contains the source files for the website. If you want to use
container immersion to _learn Docker_, visit the site at the links above. You only
need to checkout the code in this repository if you want to contribute to the
project by modifying or improving the website.

## About Container Immersion

Many years ago, when [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was a relatively new
technology, I used [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) to learn how to use
it. Git Immersion is based on the premise that the best way to learn a new
technology is by immersing yourself in it and *using it*.

I found Git Immersion such an effective tool for learning Git that I was
inspired to create a similar tutorial for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). I
hope that Container Immersion can be as effective for others as I found Git
Immersion to be for me.

## Setup Dev Environment

 1. Clone the repository.
    `git clone git@github.com:mkasberg/container-immersion.git`
 2. You need to have Ruby installed. I use
    [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).
 3. Make sure Bundler is installed. `gem install bundler`
 4. Install Jekyll & dependencies. `cd container-immersion && bundle install`
    - You may need some native dependencies installed to build the Ruby
      dependencies. On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev`
 5. Run the site. `bundle exec jekyll serve`. You can visit the site at
    [http://localhost:4000/container-immersion/](http://localhost:4000/container-immersion/).
    Essentially, this is just Jekyll. So read the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
    docs if you get stuck.

### About Jekyll

Container Immersion if built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static
site generator. When you run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, Jekyll will watch for
changes and continue regenerating the site and serving it from `_site` until you
hit `^C`. Don't edit the files in `_site` directly, since they are just
generated files.

### Project Structure

 - HTML layouts are at `_layouts`. We have a layout for the homepage, table of
   contents, and the lab pages.
 - These layouts can include HTML snippets from `_includes` (like the nav bar).
 - CSS is at `assets/css/immersion.scss`.
 - Each lab is a Markdown file at `_labs`. Jekyll converts it to a page using
   the `lab.html` layout.
